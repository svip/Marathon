Marathon allows you to keep track of your television shows, and other video 
files associated by their own title.

This is helpful if your files are scattered across saveral partitions due to
disk size issues, general torrent directories and so on.  Further more, it will
also notify you when new episodes are available of a given show, allow you to
automatically download your shows and so forth.

REQUIRES:

 * mplayer
    
    Marathon uses mplayer as its video player, there are no intentions right now
    to allow other video players as well.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

 * screen
    
    Running Marathon in screen is *strongly* recommended.
